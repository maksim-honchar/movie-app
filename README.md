## Application architecture

- The application uses the following technology stack: TypeScript, React, Redux, Material-UI, Firebase, react-router-dom, webpack.
- The file folder contains two files. This is sample_movie.txt for uploading files to the firebase server and readme.pdf which explains the architecture of the application.
- The src folder contains folders and files responsible for UI and application logic.
- The controllers folder contains components responsible for the application logic.
- The view folder contains components that are responsible for displaying UI.
- The redux folder contains a store and a reducer
- The utils folder, as the name implies, contains constants, interfaces, a custom hook,
- Firebase folder is responsible for firebase settings
- For the sake of ease of use of this application, I am not using private transfer of the .env file with passwords.
